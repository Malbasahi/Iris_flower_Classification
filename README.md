# Iris_flower_Classification
The project is focused on building and evaluating machine learning models for the classification of iris flower species using the Iris dataset. This dataset contains measurements of four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) for three different iris species (setosa, versicolor, and virginica).
